Airtime Voucher Sales prediction using kalman filter




The main objective of this paper is to predict the airtime voucher sales according to previous sales data. In this work, we contribute the first air time voucher dataset for sales prediction. The company practices a traditional prediction system using spreadsheets which makes it difficult to deal with the big data. This implies that almost every retailer, regardless of size, may create fundamental sales predictions without spending money on additional new resources or procedures. And the accuracy of sales forecasting is challenging due to the volatile and non-linear nature of the financial sales. Since sales forecasting is crucial in any sector, it has recently gained huge popularity to boost market operations and productivity due to new technologies.

The project's main goal is to show how the well-known Kalman filter may be used to predict time-series data and how it is related to optimum adaptive forecasting. It is demonstrated that the filter makes forecasts for a single time series made up of trends, trends-changes, and stochastic disturbances that are equal to those made by Thiol-Nerlove-Wage, who created optimum adaptive forecasting for such a series in 1964. The filter's use is demonstrated numerically, and the conclusions of the analysis are validated.

Using the distributor of air time vouchers as an example, the variation process of stock price is considered as a maneuvering system, and the state space model of sales prediction can be created based on the fluctuation of the sales prediction and the dynamic tracking features of the Kalman filter. Using the Kalman predictor and Python, the forecasting results for five different voucher kinds from May 07, 2020, to February 2, 2022, are provided. The outcome demonstrates that the forecast is accurate, straightforward, and quick.
